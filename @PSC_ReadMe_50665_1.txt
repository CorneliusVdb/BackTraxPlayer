Title: MP3 class with ID3v2 and ID3v1 support
Description: A simple class for playing MP3 with MCI, plus ID3v1 and ID3v2 support. ID3v2 supports only reading, but it is the most complete VB reading you've seen on PSC. It is still a work in progress though, and it would be great if you could test it. Supports CRC-32 validating, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 character coding and getting any information you might want out of the tag. The class itself is constructed to be optimal in speed and length of code, and has a complete error detection. And it is all commented so you have a big chance of learning new out of the code. And if you don't like the MCI MP3 playing support, it shouldn't be too hard to rip it out ;) Enjoy!
